//! Build-script side of `alt-icons`.
//!
//! Call [`configure`] from your `build.rs` with the complete icon set. It does two
//! things: bakes the `Default` icon into the executable as a real `RT_GROUP_ICON`
//! resource, so the binary you ship already has your icon, and generates the
//! `AppIcon` enum that [`alt_icons::set_icon`] takes.
//!
//! The build script is the single declaration site on purpose. It runs before macro
//! expansion, so it could never read an icon list declared by a macro — which means
//! a macro-based API would force the same list to be written twice, in two places
//! that can silently drift apart.
